//  Name    : shiftOutX library                              
//  Author  : Juan Hernandez 
//  Date    : March 3 2011    
//  Modified: January 29 2012                                 
//  Version : 1.0                                             
//  Notes   : free as in libre not gratis, actually it's also gratis.
//          : you can shift out to as many as 256 registers because
//			: the variable that holds the register quantity can only 
//			: count up to 256. but I doubt that anybody needs that many  
//			: that would be 256 X 8 = 2048 outputs that's pazzo
//			: juanh0238@yahoo.com   please send any suggestions

		//I did not included dataMode in the constructors because all the parameters are the same uint8_t
		//I am new to programming I did not know how to do it, but I included functions to set both clockDivider
		//and dataMode, by default they are set to SPI_CLOCK_DIV4 and SPI_MODE0 for dataMode.	
		//I used the already available functions from the SPI library to initialize SPI 
		//since they take care of setting the right pins and everything for the right MCU and board like Mega, 
		//UNO and all that, the only function I did not use was SPI.transfer() 
		//I figured including the actual code in each call to send data would be better then calling a function,
		//if you have 8 registers thats eight calls to the function or 32 if you are shifting out to 32 registers. 
		//also instead of using an integer like in version one. I used a pointer to uint8_ datatype and reseved memory with 
		//malloc for the number of registers needed. A function to send out the bits was added sendOut() this function
		//sets clockDivider and dataMode each time bits are send out just in case you are using more then one chain of 
		//registers or if you are using SPI for other devices and they require those settings to be diferent 
		//you don't have to remember to make calls to SPI.setDataMode() or SPI.setClockDivider() just set it once and
		//after that just use the functions to turn on or off pins and that's it.
		
		//next project is to add the functionality of SPI to the LiquidCrystal Library to use a shift register
		//I have seen a library that does that but with software. I am going to try to implement that same idea with SPI
		//to be able to use the same pins except of course the ssPin, 
		
		
		//turn on and off specific pins
		//self explanatory these functions turn on and off individual shift register pins by number
